            "content": "Bread is one of the oldest prepared foods that dates back to the Neolithic era. The first bread produced was probably cooked versions of a grain-paste, made from roasted and ground cereal grains and water, and may have been developed by accidental cooking or deliberate experimentation with water and grain flour. Descendants of these early breads are still commonly made from various grains worldwide, including maize, wheat, and rice. Bread is a staple food prepared from a dough of flour and water, usually by baking. Throughout recorded history, it has been a prominent food in large parts of the world and is one of the oldest man-made foods, having been of significant importance since the dawn of agriculture."

            "content": "The process of making bread is a simple one. It involves the mixing of flour, water, salt, and yeast. The yeast is the most important ingredient in the bread making process. It is the yeast that makes the bread rise. The yeast is a living organism that feeds on the sugar in the flour. The yeast produces carbon dioxide gas, which causes the bread to rise. The yeast also produces alcohol, which gives the bread its flavor. The yeast is added to the flour and water mixture and allowed to ferment. The dough is then kneaded and shaped into loaves. The loaves are then baked in an oven. The baking process causes the yeast to produce more carbon dioxide gas, which causes the bread to rise even more. The baking process also causes the alcohol to evaporate, which gives the bread its flavor."

            "content": "There are many different types of bread. Some of the most popular types of bread include white bread, whole wheat bread, rye bread, and sourdough bread. White bread is made from white flour, which is made from the endosperm of the wheat grain. Whole wheat bread is made from whole wheat flour, which is made from the entire wheat grain. Rye bread is made from rye flour, which is made from the rye grain. Sourdough bread is made from sourdough starter, which is a mixture of flour and water that has been allowed to ferment. Sourdough bread has a sour taste, which is caused by the lactic acid that is produced during the fermentation process."

            "name": "Making Bread: Ingredients",
            "content": "The basic ingredients for bread are flour, water, and yeast. The process begins with mixing these ingredients together. The yeast is responsible for making the dough rise. It's a type of fungus that ferments sugars in the dough, producing carbon dioxide gas. This gas gets trapped within the dough, causing it to inflate. Another important ingredient in many bread recipes is salt. It's not just there for flavor; it also helps control the fermentation process by slowing it down. Some breads, like Irish soda bread, are made with baking soda instead of yeast, and are known as quick breads."

The process was developed in 1961 by the British Baking Industries Research Association based at Chorleywood. The process is able to use lower-protein wheat, and to produce bread at a much faster rate than older methods, and is now used to make 80% of the UK's bread.

            "name": "The Magic of Sourdough",
            "content": "Sourdough is a type of bread made by the fermentation of dough using naturally occurring lactobacilli and yeast. It has a mildly sour taste not present in most breads made with baker's yeast, and better inherent keeping qualities than other breads, due to the lactic acid produced by the lactobacilli. The preparation of sourdough begins with a pre-ferment (the 'starter' or 'leaven', also known as the 'chief', 'chef', 'head', 'mother' or 'sponge'), a mixture of flour and water, containing a colony of microorganisms including wild yeast and lactobacilli. The purpose of the starter is to produce a vigorous leaven and to develop the flavour of the bread. In practice there are several kinds of starters, as the ratio of water to flour in the starter (hydration) varies. A starter may be a liquid batter or a stiff dough."

            "content": "An English muffin is a small, round, flat yeast-leavened bread which is commonly sliced horizontally, toasted, and buttered. It is commonly used as a breakfast food. The term English muffin is used in North America to distinguish the muffin from the American muffin, which is a sweet quickbread, similar to a cupcake in size and cooking methods. English muffins are also available in a larger size, which is typically served as a sandwich base. English muffins are typically served toasted with butter and/or jam. English muffins are also used as the bread in a variety of breakfast sandwiches, and are an essential ingredient in the breakfast dish Eggs Benedict."

            "content": "A bagel is a bread product originated in the Jewish communities of Poland. It is traditionally shaped by hand into the form of a ring from yeasted wheat dough, roughly hand-sized, that is first boiled for a short time in water and then baked. The result is a dense, chewy, doughy interior with a browned and sometimes crispy exterior. Bagels are often topped with seeds baked on the outer crust, with the traditional ones being poppy or sesame seeds. They may also be topped with onions, garlic, or everything seasoning. Some may have salt sprinkled on their surface, and there are different dough types such as whole-grain or rye. Though once considered a primarily Jewish food, bagels have become popular worldwide."

            "name": "Pastries",
            "content": "A pastry is a dough of flour, water and shortening (solid fats, including butter) that may be savoury or sweetened. Sweetened pastries are often described as bakers' confectionery. The word 'pastries' suggests many kinds of baked products made from ingredients such as flour, sugar, milk, butter, shortening, baking powder, and eggs. Small tarts and other sweet baked products are called pastries. Common pastry dishes include pies, tarts, quiches, croissants, and pasties. Pastries can also be made savory with ingredients such as meat, cheese, and vegetables. Pastries are often eaten with a cup of coffee or tea as a breakfast or snack. Pastries can be traced back to the ancient Mediterranean. The ancient Greeks and Romans used pastries made of flour, water, and honey to create meals. The idea of making a meal out of flour, water, and honey was a new concept and therefore the Greeks and Romans were the first to create pastries."
