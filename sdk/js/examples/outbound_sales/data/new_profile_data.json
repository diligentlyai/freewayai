I made long term relationships with companies where I could make a significant impact augmenting their existing development team. See https://mdcox.net/work\n \n Sample projects include:\n \n  - As a primary architect with a very small team within a Fortune 100 healthcare company, created a web and mobile app for consumer health and wellness. Our chosen stack included React Native (iOS and Android), react.js web (ES6), node.js, MongoDB, Neo4j, and RabbitMQ. All of this was architected with a microservices approach in the company's first secure HIPAA compliant AWS deploy.\n \n  - Rebuilt and consolidated the API for a local high-growth startup that was starting to feel growing pains with their existing API. The new API is written in the latest node.js with ES7 async/await, leveraging Swagger / OpenAPI for API validation and documentation. Tests and coverage in jest. The API also integrates with Kong as an API gateway for consolidated authentication and rate limiting. All of this is deployed to Google Cloud Platform using Kubernetes.\n \n  - Built the initial product of a new startup (end to end) from a repeat entrepreneur. I had a lot of leeway on the technology stack and I've chosen a mobile-friendly isomorphic (SSR) React application. The API is GraphQL using Apollo's frameworks with TypeScript throughout. Tests in jest as well as some e2e smoke tests using cypress. Deployments are handled via Circle CI to AWS ECS into a Docker Swarm.\n \n  - Created a custom WYSIWYG editor using React, Redux, and Immutable.js for a Boston startup which is a core component of their product. The editor uses Draft.js for rich text editing where necessary, but is otherwise built from the ground up. Unit tests in enzyme with mocha.I've contracted with a variety of companies, but mostly local startups, helping to build applications that are fast, robust, and scalable.
